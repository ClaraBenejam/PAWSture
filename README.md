#Installation process.

- yolo11 installation (and its dependencies): pip install ultralytics
- pytorch installation: Despite it being installed already by the previous command, it is recommended to change its version to one that can utilze the GPU device. Its version will entirely depend on the version of CUDA                                  installed already in the device. The one used originally is torch 2.3.1.
